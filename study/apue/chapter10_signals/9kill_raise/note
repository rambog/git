int kill(pid_t pid, int signo)

pid > 0     the signal is sent to the process whose process ID is pid
pid == 0    the signal is sent to all process whose process group ID equals the
            process group ID of the sender and for which the sender has permission
            to send the signal. Note that the term all processes excludes an 
            implementation-defined set of system processes. For most UNIX
            systems, this set of system processes includes the kernel processes and init.
pid < 0     the signal is sent to all processes whose process group ID equal the
            absolute value of pid and for which the sender has permission to send the
            signal. Again, the set of all processes excludes certain system processes
            as described earlier.
pid == -1   the signal is sent to all processes on the system for which the sender has
            permission to send the signal. As before, the set of processes excludes certain
            system processes.
