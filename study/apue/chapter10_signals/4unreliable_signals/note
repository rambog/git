one problem with these early versions was that action for a signal was
reset to its default each time the signal occurred
eg:

int sig_int();
...
signal(SIGINT, sig_int);
...

sig_int()
{
                                    /* in here may occur another signal so new signal will lost */
    signal(SIGINT, sig_int);
}

another problem :
prevent the following signals from interrupting me, but remember if they do occur
er:

int sig_int();
int sig_int_flag;

main()
{
    signal(SIG_INT, sig_int);
    ...
    while (sig_int_flag == 0)
                                    /* if in here occur a signal 
                                       judge the sig_int_flag == 0
                                       occur signal sig_int_flag = 1
                                       pause()

                                       the system maybe pause forever
                                    */
        pause();

    ...
}
sig_int()
{
                                    /* in here may lost one signal */
    signal(SIGINT, sig_int);
    sig_int_flag = 1;
}
