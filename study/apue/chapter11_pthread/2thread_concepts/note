A thread consists of the information necessary to represent an execution context
within a process. This includes a thread ID that identifies the thread within a
process, a set of register values, a stack, a scheduling priority and policy, a
signal mask, an errno variable, and thread-specific data, Everything within a 
process is sharable among the threads in a process, including the text of the
executable program, the program's global and heap memory, the stacks and the 
file descriptors.
