A mutex is basically a lock that we set(lock) before accessing a shared
resource and release(unlock) when we're done. While it is set, any other
thread that tries to set it will block until we release it
If more than one thread is blocked when we unlock the mutex, then all
threads blocked on the lock will be made runnable, and the first one to
run will be able to set lock. Then others will see that the mutex is 
still locked and go back to waiting for it to become available again
In this way only one thread will proceed at a time.
