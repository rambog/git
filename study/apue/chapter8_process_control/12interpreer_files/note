All contemporary UNIX systems support interpreter files. These files are text files that
begin with a line of the form
#! pathname [optional-argument]

The pathname is normally an absolute pathname, since no special operations are performed
on it(i.e.,PATH is not used). The recognition of these files is done within the kernel
as part of processing the exec system call. The actual file that gets executed by the 
kernel is not the interpreter file, buf rather the file specified by the pathname on the
first line of the interpreter file. Be sure to differentiate between the interpreter file
--a text file that begins with #!--and the interpreter, which is sepcified by the pathname
on the first line of the interpreter file.
