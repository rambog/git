Each thread has its own signal mask, but the signal disposition is shared by all
threads in the process. As a consequence, individual threads can block signals,
but when a thread modifites the action associated with a given signal, all threads
share the action, Thus, if one thread chooses to ignore a given signal, another
thread can undo that choice by restoring the default disposition or installing a
signal handler for that signal.
