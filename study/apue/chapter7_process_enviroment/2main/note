When a C program is executed by the kernel--by one of the exec functions,which we
describe in Section 8.10--a special start-up routine is called before the main
function is called. The executable program file specifies this routine as the starting
address for the program; this is set up by the link editor when it is invoked by the
C compiler. This start-up routine takes values from the kernel--the command-line
arguments and the environment--and sets things up so that the main function is called
as shown earlier.
