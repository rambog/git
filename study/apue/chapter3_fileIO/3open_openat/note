open and openat function:

int open(const char *path, int oflag, ... /* mode_t mode */);
int openat(int fd, const char *path, int oflag, ... /* mode_t mode */);

oflag:
    O_RDONLY        
    O_WRONLY
    O_RDWR
    O_NONBLOCK      if path refers to a FIFO, a block special file, or a character special file, this
                    option sets the the nonblocking mode for both the opening of the file and subsequent
                    I/O


my note:

2 , flag O_EXEC O_SEARCH is undeclared
