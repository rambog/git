A descriptor in the read set is considered ready if a read from that
descriptor won't block

A descriptor in the write set is considered ready if a write to that
descriptor won't block

A descriptor in the exception set is considered ready if an exception
condition is pending on that descriptor. Currently, an exceptopn cond-
tion corrsponds to either the arrival of out-of-band data on a network
connection or certain conditons occurring on a pseudo terminal that has
been placed into packet mode.

File descriptors for regular files always return ready for reading writing
and excption conditions.
